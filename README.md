# üìö Book Search Engine

This is a **basic search engine** for books built using **Spring Boot**, **Docker**, and **PostgreSQL**. The current implementation allows users to search for books by a given search term, add new books to the database, update existing books, and delete books. üîç

## ‚ú® Features
- **üîé Search Books**: A single endpoint to search for books by a search term.
- **‚ûï Add Books**: An endpoint to add new books to the database.
- **‚úèÔ∏è Update Books**: An endpoint to update existing books in the database.
- **üóëÔ∏è Delete Books**: An endpoint to delete books from the database.
- **üîç Search Books by ISBN**: An endpoint to search for a book by its ISBN.
- **üîç Search Books by Author**: An endpoint to search for books by an author's name.
- **üîç Search Books by Title**: An endpoint to search for books by their title.
- **üìà Scalable Design**: Built with Spring Boot, making it easy to add more features in the future.

## üíª Tech Stack
- **üñ•Ô∏è Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **üìÇ Database**: PostgreSQL
- **üê≥ Containerization**: Docker

### Inserting Bulk CSV Data for Testing

For testing purposes, you can use the `DbImporter.java` file to insert bulk CSV data from [github gist](https://gist.github.com/hhimanshu/d55d17b51e0a46a37b739d0f3d3e3c74/raw/5b9027cf7b1641546c1948caffeaa44129b7db63/books.csv) into the database.

1. **Ensure the database is running**:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. **Run the `DbImporter.java` file**:
    ```sh
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.h2.DBImporter"
    ```
